# Zombie Adventure

This will be simple text adventure game. However this one gives you the option to save and load game almost anytime. There is a scoring system built in.

Your progress is tracked and saved into external .sav file as plaintext.

The mechanics are finished except battle system which will be very simple turn based affair.

Next step is to design a story and levels, along with that the battle system will be added.

Note to experienced programmers - I know it's a bad code. I'm having circular import issues (for example I can't go from LOAD CHARACTER menu back to main menu). I'm really glad what I've learned so far so getting my code right will be the next thing to do. Along with learning some basic architecting of code.
